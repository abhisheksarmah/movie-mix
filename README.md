### Why tailwind CSS?

- Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
- Instead of opinionated predesigned components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.
- Every Tailwind utility also comes with responsive variants, making it extremely easy to build responsive interfaces without resorting to custom CSS.
- Tailwind provides tools for extracting component classes from repeated utility patterns, making it easy to update multiple instances of a component from one place.
- Tailwind is written in PostCSS and configured in JavaScript, which means you have the full power of a real programming language at your fingertips.
